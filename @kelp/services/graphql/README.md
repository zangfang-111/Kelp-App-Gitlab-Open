# @kelp/graphql

This folder contains the auto-generated types and components produced by
[`graphql-code-generator`](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator),
from the GraphQL files found inside `@kelp/client`. You can import them like:

```js
/*
 * e.g. if you have `mutation DoTheThing { ... }`, then you can import the
 * Apollo React Hook via:
 */
import { useDoTheThingMutation } from '@kelp/graphql'
```
